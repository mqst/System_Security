##Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open source virtualization technology. Specifically, KVM lets you turn Linux into a hypervisor that allows a host machine to run multiple, 
isolated virtual environments called guests or virtual machines (VMs).

##Commands (On host machine)
##Make sure your system has Virtualization Technology (VT-X) enabled.
lscpu | grep Virtualization

##Install kvm
sudo yum install qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-python libguestfs-tools virt-install
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd

##Check if kvm is installed properly
lsmod | grep -i kvm

##Now configure bridged networking capabilities
brctl show
virsh net-list
